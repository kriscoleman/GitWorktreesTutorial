# Git Worktrees Best Practices

Advanced workflows, team strategies, and optimization techniques for mastering git worktrees in professional development environments.

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Worktrees are for Context, Not Storage
- Use worktrees to maintain different development contexts
- Each worktree should have a specific purpose (feature, hotfix, review)
- Don't create worktrees just to "save" code - use branches for that

### 2. Clean and Predictable Organization
- Establish consistent naming conventions
- Keep worktree directories organized and discoverable
- Document the purpose of each worktree

### 3. Regular Maintenance is Essential
- Clean up completed worktrees promptly
- Prune orphaned references regularly
- Monitor disk usage and performance impact

## üèóÔ∏è Directory Organization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Sibling Directories (Recommended)
```
~/workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject/           # Main repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject-auth/      # Authentication feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject-ui/        # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject-hotfix/    # Emergency fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject-review/    # Code review
```

**Pros:**
- Clear separation and easy navigation
- Consistent with Git's expectations
- Easy to script and automate

**Cons:**
- More directories in parent folder
- Longer paths for deep directory structures

### Strategy 2: Nested Structure
```
~/workspace/myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/               # Main branch files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worktrees/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/          # Authentication feature
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/        # Emergency fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/       # Integration branch
```

**Pros:**
- All project files contained in one directory
- Cleaner parent directory structure

**Cons:**
- More complex Git configuration
- Potential path length issues on Windows

### Strategy 3: Purpose-Based Structure
```
~/workspace/myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/          # Main development
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-a/     # Feature development
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-b/     # Feature development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ maintenance/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/        # Emergency fixes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security/      # Security patches
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ review/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-123/        # Pull request review
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/   # Integration testing
```

**Pros:**
- Clear purpose separation
- Scales well for large teams
- Easy to understand workflow

**Cons:**
- More complex initial setup
- Requires discipline to maintain structure

## üë• Team Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Team Coordination

**Setup:**
```bash
# Team lead sets up shared structure
git worktree add ../project-integration main
git worktree add ../project-testing develop

# Each developer creates their feature worktrees
git worktree add ../project-auth-alice feature/auth-alice
git worktree add ../project-ui-bob feature/ui-bob
git worktree add ../project-api-charlie feature/api-charlie
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear ownership of features
- Parallel development without conflicts
- Centralized integration and testing

### Pattern 2: Sprint-Based Organization

**Setup:**
```bash
# Sprint 15 worktrees
git worktree add ../project-sprint15-planning sprint/15-planning
git worktree add ../project-sprint15-dev sprint/15-development
git worktree add ../project-sprint15-qa sprint/15-testing

# Previous sprint for reference/hotfixes
git worktree add ../project-sprint14-maint sprint/14-maintenance
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear sprint boundaries
- Easy context switching between sprints
- Maintains previous sprint access for fixes

### Pattern 3: Role-Based Separation

**Setup:**
```bash
# Developer worktrees
git worktree add ../project-frontend frontend/main
git worktree add ../project-backend backend/main

# QA worktrees  
git worktree add ../project-qa-manual qa/manual-testing
git worktree add ../project-qa-auto qa/automation

# DevOps worktrees
git worktree add ../project-infra infrastructure/main
git worktree add ../project-deploy deployment/staging
```

**Benefits:**
- Role-specific environments
- Specialized tooling per worktree
- Clear responsibility boundaries

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Patterns

### Single AI, Multiple Tasks
```bash
# One AI agent working on different aspects
git worktree add ../project-ai-frontend ai/frontend-work
git worktree add ../project-ai-backend ai/backend-work  
git worktree add ../project-ai-testing ai/test-work

# AI switches between worktrees for different tasks
```

### Multiple AI Agents
```bash
# Specialized AI agents
git worktree add ../project-ai-ui ai/ui-specialist
git worktree add ../project-ai-api ai/api-specialist
git worktree add ../project-ai-test ai/test-specialist
git worktree add ../project-ai-docs ai/docs-specialist

# Human coordination
git worktree add ../project-integration integration/ai-merge
```

### AI + Human Collaboration
```bash
# Human main work
git worktree add ../project-human-main feature/user-auth

# AI assistance branches
git worktree add ../project-ai-help-1 ai/auth-components
git worktree add ../project-ai-help-2 ai/auth-tests
git worktree add ../project-ai-help-3 ai/auth-docs

# Integration point
git worktree add ../project-merge integration/human-ai
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Minimize Worktree Count
- Keep active worktrees under 10 for optimal performance
- Archive or remove inactive worktrees regularly
- Use branches instead of worktrees for long-term storage

### Disk Space Management
```bash
# Monitor usage
du -sh ../*project* | sort -hr

# Clean up large files
git worktree list | while read line; do
    path=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
    echo "Worktree: $path"
    du -sh "$path"
    find "$path" -name "node_modules" -type d | head -3
    echo
done
```

### Git Performance Optimization
```bash
# Configure Git for better worktree performance
git config core.preloadindex true
git config core.fscache true
git config gc.auto 1

# Periodically run maintenance
git gc --prune=now
git worktree prune
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Access Control
- Never commit sensitive data to worktree branches
- Use separate SSH keys for different worktrees if needed
- Ensure proper file permissions on worktree directories

### Environment Isolation
```bash
# Different environment configs per worktree
# project-dev/.env
DATABASE_URL=development_database

# project-staging/.env  
DATABASE_URL=staging_database

# project-prod/.env
DATABASE_URL=production_database
```

### Secrets Management
```bash
# Use different secret management per worktree
cd ../project-dev
export SECRETS_FILE=dev-secrets.json

cd ../project-staging  
export SECRETS_FILE=staging-secrets.json
```

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### Test Environment Isolation
```bash
# Separate test databases per worktree
cd ../project-feature-a
export TEST_DB=test_feature_a

cd ../project-feature-b
export TEST_DB=test_feature_b

# Run tests without interference
npm test  # Each worktree uses its own test DB
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# CI-friendly worktree setup
git worktree add ci-builds/build-$BUILD_NUMBER $BRANCH_NAME
cd ci-builds/build-$BUILD_NUMBER
# Run tests and build
cd ../..
git worktree remove ci-builds/build-$BUILD_NUMBER
```

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Worktree Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# worktree-health-check.sh

echo "üè• Worktree Health Check"
echo "======================="

# Count worktrees
worktree_count=$(git worktree list | wc -l)
echo "üìä Active worktrees: $worktree_count"

# Check disk usage
echo "üíæ Disk usage:"
du -sh ../*$(basename $(pwd))* 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -5

# Check for uncommitted changes
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Uncommitted changes:"
git worktree list | while read line; do
    path=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
    if [ -d "$path" ]; then
        cd "$path"
        if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
            echo "   üìù $(basename "$path"): has uncommitted changes"
        fi
        cd - > /dev/null
    fi
done

# Check for stale worktrees (no commits in 30 days)
echo "‚è∞ Stale worktrees (no commits in 30 days):"
find .. -maxdepth 1 -name "*$(basename $(pwd))*" -type d -mtime +30 2>/dev/null | while read dir; do
    if [ "$dir" != "$(pwd)" ]; then
        echo "   üï∞Ô∏è  $(basename "$dir")"
    fi
done
```

### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Measure Git operation performance across worktrees
time git status  # Compare across different worktrees
time git log --oneline -10  # Check log performance
time git diff HEAD~1  # Check diff performance
```

## üöÄ Automation Scripts

### Automated Worktree Creation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-feature-worktree.sh

FEATURE_NAME=$1
if [ -z "$FEATURE_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <feature-name>"
    exit 1
fi

PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))
WORKTREE_PATH="../${PROJECT_NAME}-${FEATURE_NAME}"
BRANCH_NAME="feature/${FEATURE_NAME}"

# Create worktree
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Setup environment
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
cp ../${PROJECT_NAME}/.env.example .env
npm install  # or your setup command

echo "‚úÖ Feature worktree created: $WORKTREE_PATH"
echo "üåø Branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
echo "üìÅ Ready for development!"
```

### Automated Cleanup
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup-merged-worktrees.sh

PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))

echo "üßπ Cleaning up merged worktrees..."

for worktree_path in ../${PROJECT_NAME}-*; do
    if [ -d "$worktree_path" ] && [ "$worktree_path" != "$(pwd)" ]; then
        cd "$worktree_path"
        branch=$(git branch --show-current)
        
        # Check if branch is merged to main
        if git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD main 2>/dev/null; then
            echo "üóëÔ∏è  Removing merged worktree: $(basename "$worktree_path")"
            cd ..
            git worktree remove "$worktree_path"
            git branch -d "$branch" 2>/dev/null || true
        else
            echo "‚è≠Ô∏è  Keeping active worktree: $(basename "$worktree_path")"
        fi
        cd - > /dev/null
    fi
done

git worktree prune
echo "‚úÖ Cleanup complete!"
```

## üìà Scaling for Large Teams

### Centralized Worktree Management
```bash
# Team configuration file: .worktrees/config.json
{
  "naming_convention": "{project}-{purpose}-{developer}",
  "max_worktrees_per_dev": 5,
  "cleanup_policy": "auto_cleanup_after_merge",
  "required_purposes": ["feature", "hotfix", "review"],
  "disk_quota_mb": 5000
}
```

### Team Communication
```bash
# Slack integration for worktree events
git config alias.wtadd-notify '!f() { 
    git worktree add $1 $2 && 
    slack-notify "Created worktree: $1 for $2"; 
}; f'

git config alias.wtremove-notify '!f() { 
    git worktree remove $1 && 
    slack-notify "Removed worktree: $1"; 
}; f'
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Implement worktree quotas
#!/bin/bash
# check-worktree-quota.sh

MAX_WORKTREES=10
CURRENT_COUNT=$(git worktree list | wc -l)

if [ $CURRENT_COUNT -gt $MAX_WORKTREES ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Worktree quota exceeded: $CURRENT_COUNT/$MAX_WORKTREES"
    echo "Please clean up some worktrees before creating new ones"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Worktree quota OK: $CURRENT_COUNT/$MAX_WORKTREES"
```

## üîß Integration with Development Tools

### IDE Configuration
```json
// VSCode workspace for worktrees
{
    "folders": [
        { "name": "Main", "path": "../project" },
        { "name": "Auth Feature", "path": "../project-auth" },
        { "name": "UI Feature", "path": "../project-ui" },
        { "name": "Review", "path": "../project-review" }
    ],
    "settings": {
        "git.ignoredRepositories": ["../project-auth", "../project-ui"]
    }
}
```

### Docker Integration
```bash
# Different Docker contexts per worktree
cd ../project-dev
export DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.dev.yml

cd ../project-staging
export DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.staging.yml
```

### Package Manager Integration
```bash
# Shared node_modules across worktrees (careful with this!)
# Use only if you're sure about dependency compatibility
ln -s ../../project/node_modules node_modules
```

## üéì Training and Adoption

### Team Onboarding Checklist
- [ ] Install Git 2.5+
- [ ] Complete worktree tutorial exercises
- [ ] Set up personal naming conventions
- [ ] Install team automation scripts
- [ ] Configure IDE for worktree workflows
- [ ] Practice emergency hotfix scenario

git stash pop

# New workflow:
cd ../project-feature  # Instant context switch!
```

### Success Metrics
- Reduced context switching time
- Fewer "stash conflicts"
- Faster emergency response
- Improved parallel development
- Better code review workflows
