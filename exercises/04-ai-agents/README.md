### Step 6: Monitor Multi-Agent Progress

**Terminal 5 - Coordination Terminal:**

While your AI agents work in parallel, monitor their progress:

```bash
cd ../GitWorktreesTutorial

# View all AI agent work in real-time
watch -n 2 'git worktree list && echo "=== Recent commits ===" && git log --oneline --all --graph -10'

# Or manually check progress
git log --oneline --graph --all
git branch -a
```

### Step 7: AI Agent Coordination Meeting

As each AI agent completes work, review and coordinate:

```bash
# Create integration branch
git checkout -b integration/ai-agents-merge

# Review each agent's work
echo "# AI Agents Progress Report

## Agent Alpha (Authentication)
$(cd ../tut-agent-alpha && find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | head -10)

## Agent Beta (Frontend)  
$(cd ../tut-agent-beta && find . -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.css" | head -10)

## Agent Gamma (Backend)
$(cd ../tut-agent-gamma && find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.json" | head -10)

## Agent Delta (Testing)
$(cd ../tut-agent-delta && find . -name "*.test.js" -o -name "*.cy.js" | head -10)

## Integration Status
